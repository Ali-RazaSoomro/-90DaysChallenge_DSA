From the perspective of computer science as a subject I would say discrete mathematics is a very important subject. Knowing about stuff like sets, relations, functions, probability, combinatorics and specially graph theory is important to get a better grasp at subjects like data structures and algorithms. So in my opinion I'd say yes discrete mathematics is important and if possible you can learn the very basics at first and then start with data structures and algorithms. It's not mandatory to learn everything before starting DS and algorithms but a few basic concepts will definitely help understand DS and algorithmsÂ better.
